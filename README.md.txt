What I learned about Git and GitHub:

I learned that Git helps track changes in code and allows developers to manage versions easily.  
GitHub, on the other hand, is a platform where we can store repositories online, collaborate with others,  
and share projects conveniently. Together, they make teamwork and version control more efficient.
